### Problem solving platform

Web application that can be used for both solving and creating cs problems for others to solve.   
*I've built this app just to familiarize with ASP.NET and MVC pattern.* 

### Features
- Bring solutions for algorithms and data-structures related problems
    - The problems are divided in 3 categories: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Users can create problems and / or bring solutions for existing ones via uploading the file that contains their code (C++, C#, Pascal, Java and Python). The uploaded source code is compiled using the online [Judge0 API](https://github.com/judge0/judge0);
- Create problems
- Create classes that can be joined by users and assign problems for them to solve
