Create a view that will display all the submissions for a specific problem and modiffy the Details view by adding an extra containver
with some info about the problem, like the list of submissions, succes rate, number of submissions etc etc. (Maybe comments in the future, who knows)

The view that will display submissions will be accesibile this way:

Branch => Choose a problem => Details (Here will be a link)

Details => Results (Here will be another link)


IMPORTANT: Find a way to display the source code for each sollution. The source code will also get stored in a submission table column (to be added).
A view will be created to see the context of that damn souce code.
