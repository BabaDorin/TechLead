TO DO LIST

1) Set the views for Beginer, Intermediate and Advanced.

2) Find out how to make 3 lists with problems. 
	1st list: Beginer problems
	2nd list: Intermediate problems
	3rd list: Advance problems.


3)	 Create a folder in this project "Exercise Data". There will be all the info about the exercises (problems) 
Insert some problems in those lists. Find out how to create test files and so on.

4)	Find out how to generate a view for every problem. 
The Problem View will be like

-Problem name
-Condition
-Input-output
-submit a file button

Also, the application should track and monitorize so the user won't get repetitive points by submiting the 
same sollution for many times. 
Something will be created for tracking this thing like if the user opened that problem, then for that problem, the user will have
an amount of points. Initially it will be 0 and if he submits somethig that will pass some test, it will increase.
And, for example if the amount of points is 45 and the next submission will get 80, then, for that problem he will get 45+(80-45);

4.b) Create a view that will help the user to get to his recent problems. It will be found on Account Main Page, like 'Went through problems'.

5) Find out how to submit a file and to store it temporarely in the "Exercise Data" folder of the project

6) After that, create the Compiler Class that will have a method that finds out the programming language
 and also it will have 4 ramifications
	1st: Compiler for C#
	2nd: Compiler for Java
	3rd: Compiler for C++
	4th: Compiler for Pascal.

	The Compiler will have a timer so it will measure the compilation time of the program and also it will
	fight with the infinite loops. 
	The Compiler should have a solution for forgotten there "Console.ReadLine()" and "cin>>" and so on.

	The Compiler will test the solution and will count the points. 
	Points will be stored in a
