Last things DONE:
1) 1.16.2019: Delete function has been implemented. 






	TO DO IMMEDIATELY
>>>> Do not send the Exercise view model having backend tests to 'Details page'.
Is should be sent only on 'Update' view. 

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

	TO DO

8) Calculate the amount of points for each test case, depending on the number of tests and the total points number.

2) Error handling and displaying error pages when something happens. 

3) 404 page

4) Count total poins gained per submission.

5) Count total points for each application user.  ==> If one submission gets 20 points, he gets 20 points. If the second submission
for the same problem gets more than 20, then totalPoints + = max (previous submission result, current submission result);

6) Design !!! (For problem display, submission, profile etc etc etc etc)

7) Implement a hint sistem. Like when the user can not figure out where's the mistake, the are able to press on that hint button
and will see the last executed input, his program's output and the correct output for the first test that has not been passed;
For example, if the user's code runs for the first 4 testcases, but for the next 6 the output is wrong, then, when the hint button will 
be pressed, it will display the input, user's output and the desired output for the test number 5, because that was the first test case
the user has failed. It won't cost anything. 


2.a) Update username everywhere when the user updates his username <3
3) Make a page for admins only where they can assign roles to other users




>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> DONE <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,

1) -------- Make at least one test case mandatory into create problem view. 

2.a.01) ----- Implement the roles sistem. (Administrator etc etc etc);

2) -------- Enable edit problem only for the administrators and problem creator.

idk)

----- DONE
            //Exercise will have another property, called archieved (Bool).
            //True => Problem is 'deleted'
            //ApplicationUser will have 3 more properties: 1) SubmissionsCollection, which will contain 
            //the ids of his submissions delimited by data.delimitator.
            //In the same way, the id's of the created problems will be stored.
            //The third property will contain the ids of the problems that were created
            //by him and deleted. Only he will be able to see those problem!
----- DONE

Design for 'delete problem' view

>>>> Implement the system with check box for 'Make your source code public'
