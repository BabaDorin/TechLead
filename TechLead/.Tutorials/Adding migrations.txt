Adding migratios to the database

NuGet manager => type add-migration <migration name>

A migration will be automatically created

then, there will be the UP and Down methds. 

The UP method is for adding data, modification etc.
the Down method is for canceling data that was change within Up method.

To add some inregistrations to the db, use in Up method
Sql("insert into <table name> (field names) values (values), (values2) ....");

and then do not forget to write the opposite of this in the down method, like
Sql("delete from <table name> where filed = (values1)")....
